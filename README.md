# Opti'Find

Opti'Find is a school project produced by a group of 5 students from CESI engineering school. The goal of this project is to create a service to find a good solution to the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using a our algorithm.

The project is composed of a Frontend part and a Backend part. The Frontend is a web application that allows the user to create a VRP instance and to visualize the solution. The Backend is ... that receives the VRP instance and returns the solution. There is also tools to generate VRP instances, to test the algorithm and to compare the results with other algorithms.
