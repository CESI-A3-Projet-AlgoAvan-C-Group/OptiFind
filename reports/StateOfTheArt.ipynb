    "# State of the Art\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Since the 1990s, there has been a global awareness of the need to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997 and coming into force in 2005, marked the beginning of international commitments in this direction. This protocol introduced mechanisms to reduce emissions, but many scientists deemed these efforts insufficient to slow down global warming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In response, several countries and cities have set more ambitious goals. For example, France aims to cut its emissions by a factor of four by 2050, and cities like Paris have adopted action plans to reduce their carbon footprint. Achieving these goals requires changes in behavior and technological innovations, particularly in the transport and resource management sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME) has recently issued a call for expressions of interest to promote new and sustainable mobility solutions, emphasizing the importance of efficient delivery route management to reduce environmental impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Delivery Route Management Problem\n",
    "Delivery route management involves optimizing vehicle routes to minimize total distance, time, or costs while adhering to various constraints. This problem is often modeled as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) or its variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Variants\n",
    "- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: Finding the shortest path that visits a set of cities and returns to the starting city.\n",
    "- **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**: An extension of the TSP where multiple vehicles are used to serve a set of customers with specific demands.\n",
    "- **VRP with Time Windows (VRPTW)**: Customers must be served within specific time windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classical Approaches\n",
    "- **Exact Methods**: Integer linear programming, branch and bound, and branch and cut. These methods guarantee optimal solutions but are limited by their complexity for large instances.\n",
    "- **Metaheuristics**: Genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, simulated annealing. These approaches find near-optimal solutions in reasonable computation times.\n",
    "- **Heuristics**: Methods like the nearest neighbor and greedy algorithms, which offer quick solutions but may be far from optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current Constraints and Challenges\n",
    "### Time Windows and Vehicle Capacities\n",
    "Time windows for deliveries add complexity to the base problem, requiring vehicles to meet specific schedules. Similarly, limited vehicle capacities impose restrictions on the quantity and dimensions of transported goods. These constraints not only change the values of solutions but also the space of admissible solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Constraints\n",
    "- **Strict Time Windows**: Each delivery must be made within a predefined time interval. This requires algorithms capable of handling strict temporal constraints.\n",
    "- **Multidimensional Capacity**: Vehicles have limited capacities in terms of volume and weight, requiring algorithms that can handle these multiple dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traffic Variability\n",
    "Traffic variability, causing travel times to fluctuate, is another major constraint. To address this, models need to be dynamic, accounting for temporal variations in traffic conditions to optimize routes in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Examples\n",
    "- **Dynamic Models**: Use real-time data to adjust routes based on current traffic conditions.\n",
    "- **Robust Algorithms**: Develop algorithms that can adapt to uncertainties and variations in constraints, ensuring stable performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Methods\n",
    "### Metaheuristics\n",
    "Metaheuristics, such as genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, and simulated annealing, are widely used to solve delivery route management problems. These approaches offer flexibility to include complex constraints and can find near-optimal solutions within reasonable computation times.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Genetic Algorithms\n",
    "- **Principle**: Inspired by natural selection, these algorithms use populations of candidate solutions, evaluate them, and recombine them to create new solutions.\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Flexibility and ability to escape local minima.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Complex parameter tuning and potentially high computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ant Colony Optimization\n",
    "- **Principle**: Inspired by the behavior of ants, these algorithms use agents that deposit pheromones to signal good paths, allowing for collective optimization.\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Good performance for routing problems, adaptability.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Slow convergence in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simulated Annealing\n",
    "- **Principle**: Based on the cooling process of metals, this algorithm explores the solution space by accepting worse solutions with a probability that decreases over time.\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Ability to escape local minima.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Slow convergence and sensitivity to parameter settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exact Methods\n",
    "Exact methods, such as integer linear programming, guarantee optimal solutions but are often limited by their computational complexity for large instances. Recent advances in combinatorial optimization and problem decomposition techniques allow for handling increasingly larger instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples of Exact Methods\n",
    "- **Branch and Bound**: Systematically explores all possible solutions by dividing them into smaller subproblems.\n",
    "- **Branch and Cut**: An extension of branch and bound that adds cutting planes to reduce the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hybrid Approaches\n",
    "Combining metaheuristics and exact methods can leverage the strengths of both. For instance, a metaheuristic can provide a good initial solution, which is then refined using exact methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples of Hybrid Approaches\n",
    "- **Matheuristics**: Combining metaheuristics with mathematical programming.\n",
    "- **Memetic Algorithms**: Combining genetic algorithms with local search techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Studies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning Approaches to VRP\n",

The study concludes that Tabu Search performs best for real-time disruptions, followed by Ant Colony Optimization and Genetic Algorithm (Kaja, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Industrial Case Study\n",
    "- **Jayarathna et al. (2022)** in their article *\"Industrial Vehicle Routing Problem: A Case Study\"* address a real-world VRP application in the FMCG industry, using a centralized delivery strategy to optimize truck allocation and reduce costs. Their study demonstrates a 34% cost saving with the new strategy compared to the existing decentralized system (Jayarathna, Lanel, & Juman, 2022).\n",
